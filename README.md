bigi
======

JavaScript library to manipulate big integers. Package of `jsbn` made by [Tom Wu](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/)

Pronounced either like "big I" or "biggie".

**Important Note**: Please don't use this library for actual big integer operations. We may aggressively prune the library so that it just supports operations necessary for CryptoCoinJS.
